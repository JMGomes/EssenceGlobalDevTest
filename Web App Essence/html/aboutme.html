<p>I'm a 24 years old guy from Portugal and I am a Software Engineer and this could be viewed as my little cover letter.</p>
<p>I’ve studied in University of Minho which is one of the best in Portugal finishing my master’s dissertation with 18/20 grade. In this masters I specialized in Cryptography, Distributed Systems, Computer Graphics and Computer Networks.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I worked 1year and 6 months in a really successful start-up company, I be a part of a team of two guys who worked very hard to grew the company from 2 clients to 20 clients in this very short period. Also I had a really successful passage at Bosch Car Multimedia in Braga, which counts with almost 3000 collaborators.</p>
<p>I am really proud of my academic background and my work experience, which I can deliver recommendation letters from OnVirtualGym CEO and my supervisor at Bosch Car Multimedia.</p>
<br><br>
<p>I am passion about software development and I am really enthusiastic about working at Essence Global from what saw about the company environment. Josh and Jack seemed like a great people to work with. </p>
<p>I know I am not the most experience or most gifted Software Engineer ever but one thing I know, everywhere I have been people liked my work and working with me, I really like to get out of my comfort zone and taking challenges. I really motivated and I know that if you guys give me an opportunity you will never regret it.</p>
<br>
<p>Hope you guys liked me and my solution.</p>
<p>Many Thanks and Best Regards</p>
<p>João Manuel Gomes</p>
